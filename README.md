## üìù Project Overview

This project aims to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 per year. It leverages machine learning algorithms to classify income levels, utilizing techniques for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model optimization.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- **`main.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing:
  - Data preprocessing steps.
  - Feature engineering and selection.
  - Exploratory data analysis.
  - Model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.
- **`data/`**: Folder containing the dataset used in this project.
- **`KerasTuner/`**: This folder contains files and configurations generated during the hyperparameter tuning process.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries for Analysis and Modeling**:
  - `pandas` and `numpy`: Data manipulation and numerical computations.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: Visualizations for insights and patterns.
  - `scikit-learn`: Machine learning model implementation and evaluation.
  - `keras_tuner`: Hyperparameter tuning for optimal model performance.
  - `tensorflow`: Deep learning framework used for building and training models.
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## üí° Insights and Results

- **Influential Factors**: Features like education, age, and hours worked were significant predictors of income level.
- **Model Performance**:
  - The dataset is `highly imbalanced`, with `76%` of instances labeled `<=50K` and only `24%` labeled `>50K`, affecting the models' ability to predict the minority class effectively.
  - `Both` models performed `better` on the majority class `(<=50K)`, with higher precision and recall compared to the minority class (>50K).
  - The `Random Forest` model `struggled` with recall for the `minority class`, missing some true positives.
  - The `tuned Neural Network` model improved performance for the `minority class` but still showed lower recall, highlighting the challenge posed by the imbalance.
  - `Handling` the `imbalance`, may lead to better results, especially for the minority class (>50K).
